 * (to be given to drivers). A "collection of Observables" is a JavaScript
 * object where keys match the driver names registered by the `drivers` object,
 * and values are the Observables. Refer to the documentation of each driver to
 * see more details on what types of sources it outputs and sinks it receives.
 *

 * and outputs a collection of `sinks` Observables.
 * @param {Object} drivers an object where keys are driver names and values

 * **Example:**
 * ```js

 * // ...
 * const dispose = run(); // Executes the application
 * // ...
 * dispose();

 * `run`. `sources` is the collection of driver sources, `sinks` is the
 * collection of driver sinks, these can be used for debugging or testing. `run`
